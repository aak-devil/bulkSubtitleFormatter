Everyone has a way of living their life.

I am very particular about how I store my digital files.

I generally make it a point to download subtitle files from addic7ed.com

They generally name their files like this: Silicon Valley - 01x01 - Minimum Viable Product.KILLERS.English.C.edit.Addic7ed.com.srt

I manually rename it to: Silicon Valley - 01x01 - Minimum Viable Product.srt

Then the particular video file gets renamed to: Silicon Valley - 01x01 - Minimum Viable Product.mp4

You get the structure don't you?


The idea is to automate this process.

I will first start with filtering down the srt files to the format I prefer

Maybe in the future I can automate the process of renaming the video files as well.
